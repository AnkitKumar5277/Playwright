Mini Project — To-do App Automation

Demo App
[https://todomvc.com/examples/react/dist/](https://todomvc.com/examples/react/dist/)

Scenario
Automate core Todo actions (add, complete, delete) on the TodoMVC app

Hands-On

* Install Playwright
* Create Project
* Create end-to-end test
* Run it locally (headed & headless)
* Capture screenshots and video on failure
* View an HTML report

This teaches setup, locators, assertions, interactions, reporting

Tools

* Node.js
* Playwright (use latest if possible)
* VS Code (or any editor)

End Result

* A working Playwright test that runs locally, produces an HTML report, and a screenshot showing the final todo list

Mini Project — To-do App Automation

Demo App
[https://todomvc.com/examples/react/dist/](https://todomvc.com/examples/react/dist/)

Scenario
Automate core Todo actions (add, complete, delete) on the TodoMVC app

Hands-On

* Install Playwright
* Create Project
* Create end-to-end test
* Run it locally (headed & headless)
* Capture screenshots and video on failure
* View an HTML report

This teaches setup, locators, assertions, interactions, reporting

Tools

* Node.js
* Playwright (use latest if possible)
* VS Code (or any editor)

End Result

* A working Playwright test that runs locally, produces an HTML report, and a screenshot showing the final todo list

Project Goals (measurable)

1. Install Playwright and create tests
2. Automate adding 3 todos, mark 1 as completed, delete
3. Generate Playwright HTML report and open it
4. Add assertions and check failure in report
5. Take screenshots and video on failure and attach to report
6. Run with interactive UI
7. Run in debug mode
8. Run with trace on
